								<p>I am a highly skilled and results-driven software engineer with a strong background in backend development and a passion for leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive business growth and enhance user experiences. With a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Chicago and a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, I bring a solid foundation in software engineering principles and a track record of delivering innovative projects. From spearheading the design process for feature-rich APIs to automating workflows and optimizing performance, I thrive in dynamic environments where I can apply my expertise in Python, JavaScript, Kubernetes, and cloud architecture. Committed to staying at the forefront of the industry, I continuously expand my skills and certifications to ensure I deliver solutions that meet the highest standards.</p>

								<h3>Software Engineering Intern @ Apple</h3>
								<p>I had the privilege of leading the design process for an API with extensive features aimed at empowering support teams in triaging customer support tickets. By automating the creation of templated JIRA stories, we established a structured approach to handling escalations. To bring this vision to life, I personally implemented the REST API backend using Python and deployed it as a Kubernetes service integrated with Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment. This automation not only streamlined the ticketing process but also greatly improved time management. In order to ensure the success of the API, I actively sought feedback from agile teams through effective communication channels, collaborating closely with Product Managers to plan API features and outline a comprehensive software development life cycle (SDLC) roadmap. As part of the integration efforts, I revamped five legacy services into fault-tolerant Python applications capable of horizontal scaling within the Kubernetes environment. This integration with the API resulted in an impressive 2x reduction in issue diagnosis time, benefiting the organization as a whole. To facilitate seamless adoption, I authored detailed documentation that provided stakeholders with a clear understanding of the API's functionality. Additionally, I assisted five teams in successfully integrating the API into their web services, further expanding its reach and impact.</p>
								<h3>Software Engineer 2 @ EagleView</h3>
								<p>As an integral member of a specialized team, I collaborated on the architecture and development of the EagleView Assess tool, designed for real estate property inspection. Our primary objective was to fully automate the process of damage inspection for roofs using aerial imagery. To achieve this, I engineered a state-managed Python workflow that efficiently triggered workflows for assessing property damage. This automation eliminated the need for manual inspections and significantly reduced report generation time by an impressive three days. Employing creative problem-solving skills, I devised a complex RESTful API that effectively partitioned real estate images into smaller tiles. This innovative approach drastically reduced anomaly detection time by fivefold, enhancing the efficiency of the overall process. Recognizing the importance of clear and accessible documentation, I standardized the API documentation using Swagger. This enabled us to distill intricate API functions into user-friendly code snippets, ensuring that non-technical teams could easily understand and utilize the API. This hands-on approach greatly facilitated API adoption and empowered teams to leverage the tool effectively.</p>
								<h3>Software Developer @ Graphene AI</h3>
								<p>I had the remarkable opportunity to disrupt the healthcare industry by engineering the Mavis AI market research engine, revolutionizing the way clients such as P&G, Abbott, and Sanofi obtain unbiased insights with swift turnaround time. Leveraging my technical expertise, I demonstrated adaptability by spearheading the development process for JSON compatible Python APIs. These APIs efficiently ingested product reviews into Apache Kafka and Redis, ensuring seamless data integration while upholding 100% data confidentiality. Through this innovative approach, we were able to provide our clients with a robust and secure platform to analyze market data and gain valuable insights. In addition to my technical contributions, I also excelled in building strong client relationships. By effectively managing priorities and delivering exceptional results, I increased visibility for our team and cultivated strong partnerships with our clients. Through my contributions in developing secure APIs and nurturing client relationships, I made a significant impact on the success of the project and propelled my own professional growth within the organization.</p>
								<h3>Software Engineering Intern @ MySmartPrice</h3>
								<p>I played an instrumental role in the development of the official MySmartPrice Google Chrome Extension, which has now garnered an impressive user base of over 1 million active users. This extension serves as a comprehensive shopping tool, catering to a diverse range of categories including mobiles, computers, lifestyle products, books, and personal care items. By contributing my expertise and collaborating closely with the development team, we successfully created a seamless browsing experience that enables users to effortlessly compare prices, track product discounts, and make informed purchasing decisions. The widespread adoption and positive feedback from users highlight the value and impact of the MySmartPrice Google Chrome Extension in empowering online shoppers with real-time information and facilitating smart shopping choices.</p>

								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Hello there! Welcome to my world of interests and accomplishments. I love nature and animals, with a special fondness for cats and dogs. When I'm not surrounded by furry friends, you can usually find me sipping on a cup of coffee and exploring the realms of technology.</p>
								<p>Writing holds a special place in my heart, particularly when it comes to crafting fiction and stories inspired by my own life. I express my creativity through two blogs, <a href="https://nothingcanstopourmarch.wordpress.com">Nothing Can Stop Our March</a> and <a href="https://thepathfinder42.wordpress.com">The Pathfinder 42</a>.</p>
								<p>I am a huge fan of MOBA games and I spend a lot of my free time assembling gaming PCs from scratch.</p>
								<p>Thrillers and murder mysteries are my go-to genres when it comes to reading. There's something captivating about unraveling intricate plots and uncovering secrets within the pages of a gripping book.</p>
								<p>When it comes to music, my favorite band is Green Day. Their punk energy has always inspired me to be my own true self. I also enjoy listening to Linkin Park, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pink Floyd, and Nirvana. And yes, Taylor Swift's music is a guilty pleasure of mine too.</p>
								<p>I can proudly call myself a HUGE Seinfeld fan. Serenity now, insanity later.</p>
								<p>Speaking of technology, I've had the privilege of achieving notable milestones in this field. In the Science Olympiad, I secured a place among the top 500 students in South East Asia, showcasing my passion for scientific exploration. Furthermore, my exceptional performance in the CBSE national exams earned me the honor of being felicitated by the Education Minister of India. In 2018, I was recognized with the prestigious AMD Best Student Project Award for my Bachelor's project, which contributed to the advancement of Smart Cities. This recognition motivated me to further pursue my passion. I even submitted a paper on the same project to the 2019 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition in Long Beach, California, demonstrating my commitment to innovation. Professionally, I earned the Above & Beyond Performance award during my time at EagleView, showcasing my dedication and exemplary work ethic.</p>
								<p>Join me on this exciting journey as I continue to explore my passions, make new discoveries, and embrace the wonders that life has to offer.</p>
